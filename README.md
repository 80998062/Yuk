## PS

I am just running this project in my spare time:

- on one hand , I try to write some awesome animatons  in this app

  >  using SVG and animated drawables

- on the other side, I want to become a advanced Glide user

  > Here I using Glide to loading gif ,and add gif-drawable in for better performance,cause it's written in native-C not Java
